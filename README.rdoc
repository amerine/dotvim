= Mark Turner's .vim

Welcome to the magical world of my .vim. I use this setup every day and 
finally decided to share it with the world... or at least my co-workers. 

It is based primarily on the work of {Ben Bleything}[http://bleything.net], 
the people that inspired him, and the crew at {Opscode}[http://opscode.com].  
See the Credits section below for more details.

== Installation

Pretty straightforward.  Clone and symlink:

  $ git clone git://github.com/amerine/dotvim.git ~/.vim
  $ ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

Then install/update the bundles:

  $ cd ~/.vim
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update

Then link the snippets:

  $ cd ~/.vim/bundle/snipmate_snippets && rake install  

Install the Monaco_Linux-Powerline.ttf font.
